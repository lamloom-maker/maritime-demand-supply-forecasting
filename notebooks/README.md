# Maritime Demand and Supply Forecasting (Capstone Project)

MSc capstone project focused on forecasting maritime demand and supply using statistical and machine learning models.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes maritime time-series data to forecast demand and supply trends to support decision-making in shipping and logistics.

## Models Used
- ARIMA (Statistical baseline)
- LSTM (Deep Learning)
- XGBoost (Machine Learning)

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Time-based train/test split
- Model training and evaluation (RMSE, % error)
- Model comparison and interpretation

## Data Source
UNCTAD maritime datasets  
*(Data not included due to licensing constraints)*

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` notebooks for analysis and modeling
- `docs/` project report / paper
- `data/` placeholder folder (dataset not included)

## Tools & Technologies
